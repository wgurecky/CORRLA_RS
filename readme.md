About
================

CORRLA-RS is a package for correlation, regression and random linear algebra methods in Rust.

Methods
---

Random Linear Algebra Methods

- Randomized SVD (RSVD)

Applied Math Methods

- Active Subspace Identification by KdTree and RSVD
- Principle component analysis (PCA) by RSVD
- Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) by RSVD
- Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) by RSVD

Global Sensitivity Methods

- Active subspace based global sensitivity measure [1]

Correlation Analysis Methods

- Pearson correlation
- R-squared analysis

Interpolation and Response Surfaces

- N-D Radial basis function interpolation
- Gaussian process regression (TODO)

Space Sampling Methods

- Dirichlet multivariate constrained sampler
- Others TBD

Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers:

- Differential evolution MCMC (DEMC), parallel implementation.
- Differential evolution adaptive metropolis MCMC (DREAM), parallel implementation.

Distribution Functions

- Multivariate
  - Bivariate Copula (TODO)
    - Gaussian
    - Frank
    - Clayton
    - Gumbel
  - Pair-Copula constructions (Vine-Copula) (TODO)
- Univariate
  - Normal
  - Beta
  - Exponential
  - Kernel density

Package Build
-------------

Build this rust package with:

    cargo build

To run tests

    cargo test

for an optimized build

    cargo build --release
    cargo test --release

(Optional) Build Python Bindings
--------------------------------

The pyo3 (https://pyo3.rs) package provides some tools to simplify creating python bindings to
rust programs.

Python bindings for this rust package are provided in `src/lib_math_utils_py.rs`.

First install maturin in your python env:

    pip install maturin

Then

    cargo build --release
    maturin develop --release

Then in a python terminal to test:

    >>> import corrla_rs
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> a = np.random.randn(100, 100)
    >>> n_rank, n_iters, n_oversamples = 10, 12, 8
    >>> corrla_rs.rsvd(a, n_rank, n_iters, n_oversamples)
    >>> x = np.random.randn(1000, 10)
    >>> y = np.random.randn(1000, 1)
    >>> est_order = 1
    >>> n_neighbors = 30
    >>> n_comps = 8
    >>> comps, vals, sensi = corrla_rs.active_ss(x, y, est_order, n_neighbors, n_comps)
    >>> print(comps, vals, sensi)

Rust Setup
----------

Download rustup: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Get rust dev stuff:

    rustup toolchain install stable

rustup handles toolchain stuff.  Install it first.
then for lsp (rust-analyzer):

    rustup component add rust-analyzer

To update rust toolchain

    rustup update

Installing rust programs with:

    cargo install <program_name>

Third party rust libraries (tpls) must be added as dependencies in a project Cargo.toml file.
The `*` is to grab the latest version of the tpl. Ex:

    [dependencies]
    ndarray = "*"
    nalgebra = "*"

Now when doing `cargo build`, the dependencies will automagically download and build.


To speed up compilation:

The `mold` (https://github.com/rui314/mold) linker can speed up incremental builds significantly.  First, install mold (on arch: `sudo pacman -S mold`, on ubuntu: `sudo apt get install mold`) then simply use mold when doing a cargo build or run:

    mold -run cargo build

Or, to use mold by default, add to `~/.cargo/config.toml`:

    [target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
    linker = "clang"
    rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=--ld-path=/usr/bin/mold"]

Where `/usr/bin/mold` may be different depending on the system.

Compilation times can also be somewhat reducing by using sccache (sccache package). This will maintain a local cache of compiler artifacts.

    cargo install sccache

add the following configuration to ~/.cargo/config:

    [build]
    rustc-wrapper = "sccache"
